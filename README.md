# Azure Certifications Study Notes @ Microsoft

This repository contains my **personal study notes, summaries, and learning materials** for Microsoft Azure certifications, with a focus on **cloud security engineering**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Consolidate my learning in one place
- Reinforce concepts through structured notes
- Serve as a long-term reference
- Track my progression from fundamentals to advanced security topics


## 1. Certifications Covered

## 2. Study strategy and exam tips

### Microsoft Learn (Azure Learning Paths)

- Microsoft Learn is the primary and essential resource

- Learning paths are very good for building fundamentals

- **Important**: the questions and knowledge checks on Microsoft Learn are
generally easier and more straightforward than the real exam

👉 Use Microsoft Learn as a baseline, not as your only preparation.

### How to approach the exam

- Expect **scenario-based questions**
- Pay close attention to wording such as: *most (...)*, *least (...)*, or *best (...)*
- Many questions test **judgment and trade-offs**, not just facts

Understanding ***why*** a solution is secure matters more than knowing ***what*** it is.

### Hands-on practice is critical

- Look for mocking exams online. There are many options available.

- Use the Azure Portal
