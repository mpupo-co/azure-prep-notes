# AZ-900 Introduction to Cloud Infrastructure

## 1 Describe cloud concepts

### 1.1 Describe cloud computing

**What is cloud computing**
- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet

**Describe shared responsability model**
- **Physical** security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the **cloud provider**. 
- The **consumer** is responsible for the **data and information** stored in the cloud, and for access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it.
- The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). 

**Define cloud models**
- **Pivate cloud**: hardware must be purchased for start up and maintenance. In a private cloud, organizations control resources and security.
- **Public cloud**: is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.
- **Hybrid cloud**
- **Multi-cloud**: multiple public cloud providers

**Describe the consumption-based model**

**CapEx** is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. while **OpEx** is spending money on services or products over time.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model.

### 1.2 Describe the beneficts of using cloud concepts

- **High availability**: ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.  Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service. These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).

- **Scalability**: ability to adjust resources to meet demand. Vertical scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources. Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.

- **Reliability**: bility of a system to recover from failures and continue to function

- **Predictability**: can be focused on performance, or on cost.

- **Elasticity**: the ability of a system to automatically grow when maximum capacity is reached and automatically shrink to minimize waste

- **Agility**: the ability to respond to change “rapidly” based on changes to market or environment

- **Security and Governance**

- **Manageability**: Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. 

### 1.3 Describe cloud service types

- **IaaS**: essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter. The cloud provider keeps hardware up to date, but OS maintenance and network configuration is handled by the cloud tenant.
- **PaaS**: a managed hosting environment. Cloud provider manages VMs and networking resources. Cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.
- **SaaS**: cloud provider manages all aspects of application environment. Cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the app managed by the cloud provider. Office 365 is an example of this.

**What is serverless computing?**
Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code.
