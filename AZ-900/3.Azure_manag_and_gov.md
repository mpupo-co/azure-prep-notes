## 3 Describe Azure management and governance

### 3.1 Descrie cost management in Azure

**Azure Cost Factors**

| Factor               | How it affects cost                                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource type**    | VM size, storage type, database tier, redundancy, OS/software licensing |
| **Consumption**      | Pay-as-you-go vs reserved capacity (1–3 years)               |
| **Maintenance**      | Orphaned/unneeded resources may still incur charges          |
| **Geography / Region** | Local power, labor, taxes, and regional pricing differences |
| **Network Traffic**  | Outbound data is billed; zones affect pricing                |
| **Subscription type** | Free, enterprise, pay-as-you-go, etc.                        |
| **Azure Marketplace** | Third-party solutions add extra cost                          |

**Pricing calculator**
- The pricing calculator is a calculator that helps you understand potential Azure expenses. The pricing calculator is accessible from the internet and allows you to build out a configuration. The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator has been retired.

**Microsoft Cost Management tool**
- Allows you to **check Azure resource costs** quickly.
- Enables creation of **alerts** based on resource spending. Budget, Credits and Department spendint quota alerts.
- Supports **budgets** to automate cost control.
- Provides **Cost Analysis** to explore and visualize costs by:
  - Billing cycle
  - Region
  - Resource
  - Department, subscription, or group

**Resource Tags**
- Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources. 

### 3.2 Describe features and tools in Azure for governance and compliance

**Microsoft Purview**
- Microsoft Purview is a family of data governance, risk, and compliance solutions that helps you get a single, unified view into your data. Two main solution areas comprise Microsoft Purview: **risk and compliance** and **unified data governance.**

**Azure Policy**
- Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources.
- **Policies**: individual rules applied to resources
- **Initiatives**: groups of related policies
- **Policy Enforcement**: Evaluates resources **continuously** 

**Resource locks**

- Resource locks prevent resources from being accidentally deleted or modified, even if users have sufficient permissions through Azure RBAC.  
- Locks can be applied to: Individual resources, Resource groups, Entire subscriptions.
- Types of locks: `Delete`, and `ReadOnly`. 
- Locks **override RBAC permissions**. Even resource owners must remove locks to perform blocked actions.

**Service Trust portal**
- a portal that provides access to various content, tools, and other resources about Microsoft security, privacy, and compliance practices.

### 3.3 Describe features ad tools for managing deploying Azure resources

**Tools for interacting with Azure**

- **Azure portal**: web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools.
- **Azure PowerShell**
- **Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The Azure CLI is functionally equivalent to Azure PowerShell, with the primary difference being the syntax of commands. While Azure PowerShell uses PowerShell commands, the Azure CLI uses Bash commands.

**Azure Arc**
- Azure Arc extends Azure management and governance capabilities to hybrid and multi-cloud environments, providing a centralized and unified platform for **managing all your resources**.

**Azure Resource Manager and Azure ARM templates**

- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the **deployment and management service for Azure**. It provides a management layer for creating, updating, and deleting Azure resources. Every action on Azure resources goes through ARM.

- Infrastructure as code (IaC) allows you to manage your infrastructure **programmatically**, using templates or scripts:
    - **Intro level**: Azure Cloud Shell, PowerShell, CLI
    - **Advanced**: ARM templates, Bicep

- **ARM templates** are declarative JSON files that define resources to deploy in Azure.

- **Bicep** is a simpler, declarative language for deploying Azure resources.

### 3.4 Describe monitoring tools in Azure

**Azure Advisor**
- Azure Advisor evaluates your Azure resources and provides personalized recommendations (that can be taken imediatey, postponed, or dismissed) to:
    - Improve **reliability**
    - Enhance **security**
    - Boost **performance**
    - Achieve **operational excellence**
    - Reduce **costs**


**Azure Service Health**

Azure Service Health helps you **monitor the status of Azure** globally, regionally, and for your specific resources. It combines three different services to give a complete picture:

- **Azure Status**: Provides a global view of Azure services and regions. Informs you about service outages affecting multiple regions.

- **Service Health**: Provides a **focused view** of Azure services and regions you are using.

- **Resource Health**: Gives a **tailored view** of the health of individual Azure resources. Can be integrated with **Azure Monitor** to send alerts on availability changes.


**Azure Monitor**
- Azure Monitor is a **platform for collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and acting on data** from your Azure resources, on-premises resources, and even multi-cloud resources.

- **Azure Log Analytics**: Collects and queries log data from Azure and on-premises resources, enabling analysis, filtering, and visualization of application and infrastructure information.

- **Azure Monitor Alerts**: Automatically notifies you when metrics or logs cross defined thresholds, using action groups to alert teams or trigger automated responses.

- **Application Insights**: Monitors the performance and usage of web applications, tracking requests, dependencies, failures, user sessions, and server metrics, with options for synthetic testing.
